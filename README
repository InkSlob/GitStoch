This is a model for AOQ in stoch / markov chains.  The program was originally run in python and only did outputs to screen for quick analysis of different parameters.  It was requested that plotting be added and that a user could see the results of
the run.  Python was being run on a server so I altered the code to run on JS so the browser could display Google Chart API The html / JS version works well for sample sizes of 100,000 or less.  At one million it will stall  your browser and takes awhile.

This program is based off of "Design of generalized CSP-C continuous sampling plan" in the Journal of Applied Statistics February 2000.  It is based of Dodge's orignal CSP but allows for maintaining a reduced sampling plan until C defects are found.  Whereas the original always returned to testing every sample after a defect is found.
